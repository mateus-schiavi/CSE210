I want to let clear that, although I have a strong testimony of the veracity of the Restored Gospel, I'm also a big lover of exact sciences, specially physics and chemistry.
Last semester, during the Programming with Functions course, I've developed a code in Python that performs operation with complex numbers, then, I decided to 'recicle' this idea and do it in C# but with another classes.
Down below is the classes of my final project (in total are eight classes, including the class Program):
Class 1: PhysicalCalculator: will be responsible to calculate physical properties, which includes force, mass, volume and area.
There are two methods in it: CalculateDensity, with two overloads: mass and volume, and CalculatePressure, with two overloads: force and area.
Class 2: ChemicalCalculator: will be responsible to calculate chemical properties, which includes moles, volume and hydrogen Ion concentration.
There are two methods in this class: CalculateMolarity, with two overloads: moles and volume, and CalculatepH, with only one overload: hydrogenIonConcentration.
class 3: Calculator: will work as an abstract base class for all calculators.
It will have only one method: Calculate, with two overloads: value1 and value2.
class 4: DensityCalculator: calculates density using the Calculator base class
it will have only one method, called Calculate, with two overloads: mass and volume.
class 5: PressureCalculator: calculates pressure using the Calculator base class
It will have only one method, called Calculate, with two overloads: mole and volume.
class 6: MolarityCalculator: calculates the molarity using the Calculator base class.
It will have only one method, called Calculate, with two overloads: moles and volume
class 7: pHCalculator: calculates the pH, using the calculator base class.
It will have two methods: one constructor with one overload, called pKw, and a method called Calculate with one overload called hydrogenIonConcentration.
class 8: prorgram: shows a menu allowing the user to choose which kind of operation he/she wants to performs.
It will have a method called Main, with one overload:  string[] args;
